## Server Tip of the Day

This repository contains a bash script that randomly selects a tip from a list and displays it in the terminal.

## Instructions for Using the Script
Create scripts folder
Create and Save the tips.txt, tip_of_the_day.ssh file in the scripts folder.
Run the script in the terminal using the following command:
./tip-of-the-day.sh
The script will randomly select a tip from the tips.txt file and display it in the terminal.
Make sure that the tip-of-the-day.sh script is executable before running it. You can make it executable using the following command:
chmod +x tip-of-the-day.sh
The tips.txt file should contain one tip per line. 
The tips.txt file should be located in the same directory as the tip-of-the-day.sh script.
