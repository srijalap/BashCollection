This scripts accepts two arguments. These arguments are checked with if statement. If arguments are provided, it will calculate and print out the sum, difference, product and division of the provided variables. Else, it asks the user to provide two arguments and exits.

## ex-3-interactive-input.sh
This scripts asks from user two integers input interactively. Function in while loop is added to check if inputs are an integer. If provided inputs are not integers, output will be printed asking again for valid integers input. After providing integers, the script calculates the sum, difference, product and division of the provided inputs and prints to the console.

## ex-4-functions.sh
In this exercise, we checked if two arguments are provided as arguments. If not, the script asks the user to provide two integers interactively. Two Functions are added in an external file. One fo the functions perform arithmetic operations to calculate the sum, difference, product, and division and print out the result for each operations. The important part of this exercise is that user can run this script using command interactively or by providing arguments.
